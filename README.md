# PINN-s-for-Heat-Transfer-Problem
In recent years, the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has gained popularity across several engineering disciplines due to their effectiveness in solving linear and non-linear partial differential equations (PDE) and real-world problems despite noisy data. The basic approach used to solve the PINNs is to construct the neural network and define a loss as a function of PDE and boundary/initial conditions (B.C/I.C). To get the dependent variable from the PDE, our aim is to minimize the loss function formed from fundamental equations by employing effective optimization techniques.
